Linux Commands:

For Creating Public / Private Keys
$ ssh-keygen -f <FileName>
Example: ssh-keygen -f devops

For connecting to EC2 / AWS Server from cmd:
$ ssh -i <Private Key path> servername@publicIP
Example: ssh -i C:\Users\pavan.d\devops.pem ec2-user@65.0.30.222

$ sudo su - -> for admin access
$ -> means normal user
# -> means root user(Admin) 
$ pwd -> present working directory
$ uname -> Shows System Info
$ uname -a -> Detailed system info
$ uname --help -clear documantation about cmds

d -> directory/folder
- -> file
* Absolute path means Complete path
* Relative path means you already in directory. so start cd, no need to give complete path

Linux Directory Structure: stay tuned. will describe deeply about it

 / -> root directory
 
$ cd / -> Base Location(CD means change Directory)
$ cd for home directory
$ cd <Folder-name> -> To move inside the folder
$ cd.. -> For come back from the folder
$ ls -> List down files and directories
$ ls -l -> Long listing format in alphabetical order.(-l for lengthy format)
$ ls -lr -> Long listing format in reverse alphabetical
$ ls -lt -> Latest files on top
$ ls -ltr -> Latest at bottom
$ ls -la -> All Files including hidden files and folders

$ touch <file_name> -> creates empty file
$ cat > <file_name> -> type text, then enter and then ctrl+d
					   Previous content will be replaced

$ cat >> <file_name> -> Appends text to previous content

	 * $ cat >> <Filename> -> It always append to old content : > it will remove old contect and saves new content
	 > -> usvally called as redirection
$ cat <file_name> -> To read the text inside file
$ mkdir <directory_name> - for creating directory/folder
$ rm <directory_name> for removes file
$ rmdir <directory_name> for removed directory(It can remove only when dir is empty)
$ rm -r <directory_name> for remove everything(all files) from directory (-r means recursive i.e inside as well)
$ rm -rf -> recursively forcefully delete the files and folders inside too

CRUD - Create Read Update Delete

COPY:
 cp -> copy files and folders
$ cp <source> <destination>
 mv -> move files and folders(cut and paste)
$ mv <source> <destination>

wget means webget -> to get download app link from web
$ wget <url>
$ curl <url> - its give text of terminal. it wont download

Pipeing: |
Pipe is output of first cmd becoming input of second cmd

 grep -> search for a word
$ grep <word-to-find> <File_Name>
$ grep -i <word-to-find> <File_Name> - For dnt consider case insenstive

$ cat <Filename> | grep <word-to serach> -> 

 cut -> to cut the string baced on some delimiter(-d)
$ echo <string> | cut -d <delimiter ex-/ :> -f1
$ echo <string> | cut -d <delimiter ex-/ :> -f2
$ echo <string> | cut -d <delimiter ex-/ :> -f1-8

 awk -> 
$ awk -F ":" '{print $1F}' <File_Name>
$ awk -F ":" '{print $1F,$3F}' <File_Name>
$ echo <string> | awk -F "/" '{print $1F}'
$ echo <string> | awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'
 -F means Fragment
 
Difference between $cut and $awk?
both we can use for the delimitation purpose. we can choose any delimiter to cut the text/cmd/string/url. 
But $awk has another usage. i.e column based.

 head -> to show first 10 lines of content in the the file
 tail -> to show last 10 lines of content in the file
$ cat <file-name> | head
$ cat <file_name> | tail
$ head -n 2 <filename> -> for first 2 lines
$ tail -n 2 <filename> -> for last 2 lines

logfile -> $ tail -f <log_file>
 -f = follow
 
$ find / -name <"file/folder_name"> - To search the file/folder
 / -> root directory
$ find . -name "File.folder_name"
$ find . -name "*<letters related to file/folder_name, if not sure full name>*"
 . -> current directory
